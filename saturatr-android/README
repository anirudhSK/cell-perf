Saturatr implementation for Android. The idea is to saturate the downlink and then run some measurements to see
how the packet arrivals are scheduled across three or four different phones. Hopefully with clock sync down to
1ms we should have a clean idea of what is going on wrt the downlink.

We don't need to saturate the uplink cause we can't measure that anyway.

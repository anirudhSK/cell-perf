Figured out how to run WiFi and 3G/4G at the same time on Android. 

1. Szymon's Barnacle app doesn't seem to work on the Galaxy Nexus for strange reasons. For starters, the card doesn't even go into ad-hoc mode, so all bets are off. 

2. WiFi Direct is flaky.

3. Turning on WiFi disables 3G. 

4. So now, we basically run WiFi under the Android hood by running :

1. wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/sdcard/wpa_supplicant.conf -d
2. dhcpd wlan0

where /sdcard/wpa_supplicant.conf is included in this folder as a sample.

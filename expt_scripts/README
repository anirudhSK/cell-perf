This folder contains helper scripts to help set up a 2 phone TDMA measurement experiment.
killall.sh is an android shell script cogged from the web, that can kill process by name. 

Clean experiments :
10Hz-Nov1-Take2
10Hz-Nov1-Take1
10Hz-Oct30-Take3

These three have 10Hz WiFi, somewhat reasonable cellular data, other apps were turned off on the laptop (like dropbox) and the WiFi did not blank out for sufficiently long. 

The key to getting this to work seems to be rebooting the phones whenever the wifi starts dropping packets.

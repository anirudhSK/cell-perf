Figured out how to run WiFi and 3G/4G at the same time on Android. 

1. Szymon's Barnacle app doesn't seem to work on the Galaxy Nexus for strange reasons. For starters, the card doesn't even go into ad-hoc mode, so all bets are off. 

2. WiFi Direct is flaky.

3. Turning on WiFi disables 3G. 

4. So now, we basically run WiFi under the Android hood by running :

1. wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/sdcard/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
2. dhcpcd wlan0

where /sdcard/wpa_supplicant.conf is included in this folder as a sample. 

Updates in the evening :

The dhcpd and wpa_supplicant are the Android aspects of it. These are the clients . You need some sort of a server to send out the reference broadcasts. Logically, this should be the Access Point in a managed network.

So the next question is how you get an Access Point to send out these broadcasts ? You can't really send out broadcasts on a WiFi router, at least not to my knowledge. So the next best solution is to turn a conventional Linux laptop into an Access Point.

The solution to that is hostapd (Host Access Point Daemon).

After this, you just setup the appropriate IP addresses on the laptop (the server) and the phones (clients) and you are ready to roll. 

If you really want to, you can run a dhcp server as well. Here are the details :

As a total aside, dhcpd and dhcpcd are two very different things.

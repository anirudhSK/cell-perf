10:30 am in the morning :

Running one last set of tests, one using 100Hz and the other using 10 Hz to confirm that indeed 100Hz sucks compared to 10Hz for whatever reason. 

Finished running the 100Hz test. Now running the 10Hz test. Hopefully this validates our hypothesis for good now. 

Seems to hold. The results are in 10vs100-3takes.png. I think I am moving on now. 

Next steps :

1. Co-existence, running supplicant in the background messes things up. 
2. Averaging (simple enough to do) and estimation of sync accuracy.  
3. Running actual test.
